# Algorithms and Data Structures I â€“ Code Examples and Exercises

This repository contains code examples and exercises developed throughout the Algorithms and Data Structures I course. The materials here are organized by topic and cover fundamental concepts including algorithm design, data structure implementation, and problem-solving techniques.

## Contents

- Example implementations of core data structures (arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, etc.)
- Algorithms for searching, sorting, and recursion
- Practice exercises and solutions
- Additional notes and code snippets from lectures

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to reinforce concepts learned in class and provide a reference for future study and practice in algorithms and data structures.

## Usage

Feel free to explore, use, and adapt any of the code or exercises for your own learning and projects.
